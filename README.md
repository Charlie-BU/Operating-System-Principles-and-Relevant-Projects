# Operating System Fundamentals

Welcome to the world under the hood. This repo holds everything from my Operating Systems course â€” including polished lecture slides and three hands-on projects that simulate real OS subsystems.

## ðŸ§  What's Inside?

### ðŸ“š 1. OS Principles Slides
A clean set of introduction covering the theoretical backbone of OS design â€” from process management to storage systems.

### ðŸ›— 2. Elevator Scheduling (Project 1)
> Simulates elevator dispatch strategies using scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SCAN, and more.

This project models how a multi-elevator system can be optimized for minimal wait time, using classic and modern algorithms. Itâ€™s about concurrency, fairness, and the sweet dance of real-time decisions.

### ðŸ§® 3. Memory Management Simulator (Project 2)
> Emulates paging, segmentation, and memory allocation techniques in user space.

This one dives into how RAM gets sliced and diced. Think of it like OS-level Tetris, making sure every byte fits just right.

### ðŸ“‚ 4. File System Management (Project 3)
> A simplified but functional implementation of file creation, deletion, indexing, and directory navigation.

Here, we roll our own minimalist filesystem. Blocks, inodes, directories â€” the works. It's like building your own `ext2`, but chill.
